# Fun

Simple idea.  Have fun with algorithms, patterns, data containers, etc.  

## The idea of this repo is toâ€¦

* **implement algorithms**

* **tweak design patterns**

* **explore the usefulness and purposes of data types**

## Contribute / Collaborate

Feel free to fork and make pull requests to contribute to this repo.  Please write specs. Implementing algorithms is much more fun when writing tests for them first.

Also, I would love to hear how you might do something a different way and why.

## What's currently here

* Fibonacci Sequence
* Finding the sum of a region in an integer matrix
* Determine if a given dataset is a valid binary search tree
